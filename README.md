## Home work assignments
- HW1: 
  - Image classification: Implement CNN, Resnet15, and use PCA and t-SNE to visualize learned visaul representation
  - Semantic segmentation: Implement VGG16-FCN32, SegFormer (b1), visualize predicted segmentation mask
- HW2:
  - Image generation: Implement Generative adversarial models, diffusion models
  - Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA): Implement DANN, visualize the latent space of DANN by mapping the validation images to 2D space with t-SNE, color data point by class and by domain
- HW3:
- HW4:

You could find more details in the directory of each homework.
