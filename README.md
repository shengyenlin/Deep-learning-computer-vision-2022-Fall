## Homework assignments
- HW1: 
  - Image classification: Implement CNN, Resnet15, and use PCA and t-SNE to visualize learned visaul representation
  - Semantic segmentation: Implement VGG16-FCN32, SegFormer (b1), visualize predicted segmentation mask
- HW2:
  - Image generation: Implement Generative adversarial models, diffusion models
  - Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA): Implement DANN, visualize the latent space of DANN by mapping the validation images to 2D space with t-SNE, color data point by class and by domain
- HW3
  - Zero-shot image classification: Use CLIP 
  - Image Captioning with Vision and Language Model: Implement ViT, Transformer decoder models and an evaluation metric CLIPScore
- HW4
  - 3D Novel View Synthesis with NeRF and DVGO
  - Self-supervised Pre-training for Image Classification with BYOL and Barlow Twins

You could find more details in the directory of each homework.

## Final projects 
- **Warning: I'm not the only contributor of the `final` directory, I just zip the original files and uploaded them.** We couldn't make the original repo public since the repo was created by the TAs of this class.  
- Task: 3D Indoor Scene Long Tail Segmentation
- Won the second place in the final competition
- Implement mix 3d data augmentation techniques in our team
